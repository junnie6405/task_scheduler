# task_scheduler 
>This project demonstrates the usage of topological sorting algorithms and graph data structure to prioritize tasks. 
>Assume that there exists tasks 2 called "Eating" and "Taking pills". If nothing needs to be done for "eating" task and 
>"eating" task needs to be done prior to "taking pills" task, this program tells the user to eat first and then take pills.

## General Information
The purpose of this program is to use topological sorting algorithm and general graph data structure to make something that can be used in our lives. This application can be useful to people who struggle with planning.

## Technologies Used
This program is written in Python.

## Setup
There is one main file called task_scheduler.py. However, there needs to be a text file that lists all the tasks and the dependencies of each task. 


## Room for Improvement
1. I am planning to expand this project by adding one more functionality. I would like to implement a method that have API calls and display the list of tasks that need to be done on a web page.
