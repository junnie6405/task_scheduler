# task_scheduler

We typically have many tasks/things that we need to do in our daily lives. 
On the other hand, we can't sometimes complete a certain task before completeting some other task. 
For example, we can't graduate before taking a certain amount of credits. 
We can't also write programs without learning the fundamentals of programming. 
In that regard, this task of "writing a program" is dependent on the task of "learning how to program". 
This program allows users to organize thier tasks through topological sort and tells the users what to do first.
